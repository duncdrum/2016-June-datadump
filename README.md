## Please note that the Controlled Vocabularies as linked data resource is currently under development. The data is not being regularly updated due to ongoing work to integrate the thesauri as a whole. Additionally, please note that at this time the application instructions contained in the existing thesauri introductions should be followed. Specifically, qualifiers should be included for terms from all thesauri other than "genre terms." The next data dump (scheduled for January 2017) will include the term with the qualifier encoded as an "alternative term" and as a "preferred label" for ease of use.
